# SuperFastIsFast Website README

Hey there, I'm <span id="glitch">superfastisfast</span>, and I might not be the ultimate coding guru, but I've got something pretty cool to share.

<script>
  const glitchText = document.getElementById('glitch');

  function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
  }

  function applyGlitch() {
    const originalText = glitchText.innerText;
    let glitchedText = '';

    for (let i = 0; i < originalText.length; i++) {
      glitchedText += `<span class="glitch-char" style="animation-delay: ${getRandomNumber(0, 500)}ms">${originalText[i]}</span>`;
    }

    glitchText.innerHTML = glitchedText;
  }

  applyGlitch();
</script>
